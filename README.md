In todayâ€™s competitive mobile phone market, pricing plays a crucial role in shaping a product's success and consumer perception. Similarly, understanding the relationship between a mobile phone's features and its price range is  very important, because accurate price classification not only aids manufacturers in creating competitive pricing strategies but also helps consumers make informed decisions when choosing a product that fits their budget.  Rather than predicting exact prices, this approach simplifies the decision-making process by categorizing mobile phones into four price ranges: low, medium, high, and very high. (0 (low cost), 1 (medium cost), 2 (high cost), 3 (very high cost), based on their key features, such as RAM, battery capacity, internal memory,processing power, and other attributes.

To tackle this task, various machine learning (ML) techniques are employed due to their ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within datasets. ML models used for this project are as follows: 1. **Logistic Regression**, 2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, 3. **Decision Tree**, 4. **Random Forest**, 5. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, 6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, 7. **Hybrid model combining MLP and Random Forest**, 8. **Gradient Boosting**, **K-means clustering**, 9. **Naive Bayes algorithms**.  

Using this  variety of ML techniques allows us  to analyze what is the most reliable and effective model for mobile price classification. Having mentioned this, our goals for this projects are: 

1) Exploring the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in price classification tasks.

2) Analyzing their performance based on different dataset manipulations that are performed.
